These are classes written in Java that provide the basis libraries
for the ML code compiled.

They are not designed to be extensive, and are designed for interopability
with other ML compilers.  In future, the standard libraries will be accessible
directly, but some of these classes (such as the Tuple and Function classes)
will always be needed here.

These are statically linked.
