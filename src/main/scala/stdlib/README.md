Since this is not a full language compiler, we rely on the Java Standard
Libraries to suppliment the language. This package provides the information
needed for those libraries.

In future, this will be an implementation that dynamically converts JVM
library types to information that the typechecker can use and that the
lowerer can use.

For now, it does a case analysis.
